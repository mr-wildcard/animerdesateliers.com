# micromark-extension-footnote

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use [`micromark-extension-gfm-footnote`][gfm-footnote] (or
[`micromark-extension-gfm`][gfm], which bundles includes it and all of GFM)
instead.
Those packages match how footnotes work on github.com, which is more likely
to match the expectations of your authors.

Legacy [documentation for this
package](https://github.com/micromark/micromark-extension-footnote/tree/f157eda)
is still available in Git.
